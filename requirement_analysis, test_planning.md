## Test Planning 

Use the test plan to fill in the following sections:

| Information | Description of software being tested | Person/people responsible for communicating strategic changes to the team | Digital infrastructure used in testing | Application's features and functionalities | Measures that should be taken to avoid delays |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| The section it can be found in | *1.2 Application summary* | 4.2 Test Lead | 5\. SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE RESOURCES | 2.1.1 Manual Functional UI Testing | 6\. RISK & MITIGATION |
